# Sparktro Laravel Modular

A clean and structured modular system for Laravel applications. This package helps you organize your Laravel app using a module-based architecture, making it more maintainable and scalable.

---

## 🔧 Features

- Easy to create and manage modules
- Automatic loading of routes, views, migrations per module
- PSR-4 autoloading support
- Laravel auto-discovery supported
- Ideal for large and enterprise Laravel apps

---

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
composer require mhannan-dev/sparktro-laravel-modular
````

If you're using a Laravel version with package auto-discovery, you're good to go.

Otherwise, you can manually add the service provider in your `config/app.php`:

```php
'providers' => [
    Sparktro\LaravelModular\SparkTroLaravelModularServiceProvider::class,
],
```

## 🗂️ Folder Structure

Each module follows a structure like:

```
/modules
    /Blog
        /Http
            /Controllers
        /Views
        /Routes
            web.php
        /Database
            /Migrations
```
